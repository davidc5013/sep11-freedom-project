Hello! My last blog was pretty messy, it didn't feel like i describe my thinking process straight and felt rushed (because it was kind of rushed) so I'll try my best to describe this time. Lately I've been thinking on how the layout of my game will be. In the past two blogs, there was one that was a runner, basically meaning the charcter is only moving to the right, left and jump while the other one i made in blog two, allowed the player roam around the map. And while runner seems cool, I feel like rpg would feel right. In this case I'm going to be looking at the Kaboom.JS playground and breakdown the code to a way i can understand it and do it my way. (All my previous work will be commented out to star fresh)
