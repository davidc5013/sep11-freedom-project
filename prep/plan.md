# Plan

## Tool: KABOOM.JS
## Product: A speedster rpg video game

---

## Timeline

* Starting around the middle or end of break 02/19-march 1
  *  Should be starting to create at least 2 LEVEL that should have a decent amount of room to move around.
  *  The addition of characters (CAN JUST BE PICS for now), 1 player, 3 Ais and 2 bots (the civilians)
  *  Add movement to the main player completion date for all of this: March 4

* Addiing a functionality to the ai's by giving them movement and attacks
      * This can be acheive by creating states for the ai's to know when to move or be in ideal also create one for the playe. Completion date: march 9

* Add if statements by creating a sprite that give the player the super speed if they touch it. which would increase the player speed. /march 13
      * so ill create a sprite that has no purpose other than being a icon that would give the player superpowers


* This is day where we add health bars for the player and ai's march 17


* Give civilians a purpose on being saved
    * This will be the bots/ civilians. Where I want them to be saved once ALL the bots are dead. If you approach them they'll give a dialogue of thanks but if the ais are alive then they'll give another dialouge. march 21 (Should be the end for the skelton of the game)
