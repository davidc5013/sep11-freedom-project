Hello hello, So this is my first learning log (yikes), but anyways, I've tinkering here and there, I think a main stumble in my tinkering was the "https://kaboomjs.com/doc/intro"  where  if you wanted to start anything, like character wise, it would have through a bean charcter, and i was like okay, well It doesn't matter cause i thought it would just download automotically when i inported the java script code (this one):

`import kaboom from "https://unpkg.com/kaboom@3000.0.1/dist/kaboom.mjs";`

but it didn't because when i copy this code from the website

```
// load a sprite "bean" from an image
loadSprite("bean", "sprites/bean.png")

// add something to screen
add([
    sprite("bean"),
    pos(80, 40),
])



```

It didn't work because of the fact, there was no folder or any inport of the `sprite` `bean`, so i was just left confused. Until one day I asked my friend Jason as
